GitHub starting repos

 I am a man on a mission to explore the great unknown, compatibility amonst the machines.
 
   I have been very busy exploring the many videos and websites in order to find a combination of hardware and software that
 will work on my current system.  As such, there have been countless hours spent to reveal my system's shortcommings with
 regards mostly to the video card. I am not looking for a free game or bots to produce the work!!
 
   I give thanks to  'carlbirch'  for his work in the 'letsmakegames'  series of the SDL2 engine: where the program actually works and there is limited editing (missing bits of important coding or theory).  Also a shout out to  'javidx9'  for his fortitude in producing a well paced and illustrated video (wow, what a lab and I can see the video on my phone).  Another would be 'Chero' for
the casual couch session when I crave the theory therapy.
